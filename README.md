# IoT Based Automated Traffic Control System

The GitHub Repository of Team NODEzilla for X-IoT-A 2021, an IoT event conducted in Udyam, IIT (BHU) Varanasi, where we bagged second position.

## Problem Statement we proposed

Overspeeding and rash driving is a major issue in our country which leads to many major road accidents. We chose to improve this condition by designing an automated internet of things based solution for this.

## Our solution

- We designed an electronic system which consisting of arduino micro-controller, bluetooth module and various sensors. This electronic system can be installed in the vehicle which will provide us vehicle details like its speed. You can see in the image below
